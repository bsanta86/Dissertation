		Prior to starting the professional learning course on disrupting bias, you will be asked to take an Implicit Association Test (IAT) on race. You may find it easier to pair certain attributes with one group of people compared to another. In addition, your results may depart from your personal beliefs.

Important Disclaimer: In reporting the results of the IAT test you take, possible interpretations will be provided. These results have a basis in research done (at the University of Washington, University of Virginia, Harvard University, and Yale University); however, these Universities make no claims about the validity of these suggested interpretations. If you are unprepared to encounter interpretations you might find objectionable, please do not proceed further. You may prefer to examine general information about the IAT before deciding whether or not to proceed.
